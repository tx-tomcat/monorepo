# Commonware Blockchain Modules Implementation Plan

## Overview

This document outlines the implementation plan for extending Commonware into a complete blockchain system with wallet and token transfer capabilities. The approach follows Commonware's design principles of focused, composable primitives.

## Module Architecture

### Core Blockchain Modules

1. **commonware-address** - Address management and derivation
2. **commonware-transaction** - Transaction processing and validation
3. **commonware-state** - Account state and balance management
4. **commonware-block** - Block structure and validation
5. **commonware-economics** - Fee markets and economic incentives
6. **commonware-sync** - Chain synchronization protocols

> **Note:** Transaction ordering and pool management is handled by Commonware's existing `ordered_broadcast` component, which provides Byzantine fault-tolerant transaction ordering with built-in gossip, persistence, and consensus. This eliminates the need for a separate mempool module.

### Supporting Modules

1. **commonware-wallet** - Wallet SDK and key management
2. **commonware-rpc** - JSON-RPC API server and client
3. **commonware-node** - Full node orchestration
